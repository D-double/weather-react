# WEATHER

This project was created to teach students how to use React with TypeScript. To create the project, we used the “Vite” project development and build server. During my studies I taught:
+ download custom fonts,
+ using the SCSS preprocessor,
+ naming classes according to the BEM methodology,
+ receiving and processing data from third-party APIs,
+ use "axios" for requests to the server,
+ creating temporary storage using the "reduxjs/toolkit" module,
+ error handling and waiting for data from the server using the "react-query" module.

## Recommended IDE Setup

[VSCode](https://code.visualstudio.com/) 

This template provides a minimal setup to get React working in Vite with HMR and some ESLint rules.

Currently, two official plugins are available:

- [@vitejs/plugin-react](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react/blob/main/packages/plugin-react/README.md) uses [Babel](https://babeljs.io/) for Fast Refresh
- [@vitejs/plugin-react-swc](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react-swc) uses [SWC](https://swc.rs/) for Fast Refresh


## Customize configuration
